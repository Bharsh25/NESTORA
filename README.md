# NESTORA – Full-Stack Airbnb-Style Platform (MERN)

NESTORA is a production-style full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, built using the **MERN stack**. While the project began with a structured learning path, its real complexity came from designing core features independently, integrating third-party services, and debugging real-world issues that don’t appear in tutorials.

The application supports user authentication and authorization, property listings with full CRUD functionality, cloud-based image uploads, location-based search with interactive maps, reviews and ratings, and category-based filtering. The backend is designed around RESTful APIs with modular routing, middleware, and schema-driven data models, while the frontend consumes these APIs to deliver a responsive user experience.

Most of the learning in this project happened during failure: session bugs, async request issues, broken integrations, and UI inconsistencies under real usage. Solving these problems required understanding how the frontend, backend, database, and external services interact in a production-like environment.

NESTORA is actively evolving, with ongoing improvements focused on performance, UI polish, and scalability, but the core system is stable, functional, and end-to-end complete.
